# Floodbud

FloodBud is a smart flood monitoring system that detects flood levels in real time and
informs local residents and authorities when the levels get unsafe. As evacuation and delivery of
relief goods are typically delayed when flood levels are high, it is crucial to inform both local
authorities and residents in the early stages. With FloodBud, local authorities can quickly
identify areas at risk of flash floods and respond rapidly to reduce the extensive damages on
human life and property. Successfully implementing this project will help prevent severe
damages to properties and, more importantly, save lives.
